# .dotfiles

A collection of `.dotfiles` and `bootstrap` scripts tailored towards setting up my terminal just how I like it.

This repository assumes it has been cloned into the target users home directory. To do that on an clean system though, you'll at least need to clone this repository. If you're me, you're going to use GitKraken to do that. You can do that by following the [how-to-install](https://help.gitkraken.com/gitkraken-client/how-to-install/) and (if you're on Windows) [windows-subsystem-for-linux](https://help.gitkraken.com/gitkraken-client/windows-subsystem-for-linux/) guides.
